
STEP 01:
Import the precision coordinate point data ([points_coord.gpx]) acquired at easily detectable locations on the building floor plan (corners and end-of-corridor windows). Convert the .gpx data to .shp format (points_coord.shp).

STEP 02:
Import line and polyline features from the AutoCAD DWG file (planta_baixa.dwg) into shapefile format (polylines_planta_baixa.shp and line_planta_baixa.shp). Typically, polyline data comes with fewer features representing plant details, which will facilitate data treatment.

STEP 03:
Move the treated floor plan of your building ([polylines_plantabaixa.shp]) so that the coordinates overlap with the vertices established in the field.

STEP 04:
Insert a georeferenced satellite map or image in the background of the building's floor plan with the position corrected by precision coordinates ([polylines_plantabaixa_georef.shp]).

STEP 05:
Select features representing areas of interest from the georeferenced floor plan ([polylines_plantabaixa_georef.shp]) in the attribute table, such as entrances/exits, doors, stairs, ramps, pillars, benches, and other obstacles.

STEP 06:
Extract polyline features ([polylines_plantabaixa_georef.shp]) by attribute category, generating different shapefiles ([ent_exit.shp], [door.shp], [ramp.shp], [floor.shp], ...).

STEP 07:
Transform polylines into points for the generated files ([node_ent_exit.shp], [node_door.shp], [node_ramp.shp], [node_degr.shp], ...).

STEP 08:
Create complementary nodes ([node_conect.shp]) that can connect the generated nodes through the attributes of interest ([node_ent_exit.shp], [node_door.shp], [node_ramp.shp], [node_degr.shp], ...).

STEP 09:
Connect the nodes together so that the points form straight lines between their most adjacent points, forming several corridor line features ([line_corridor.shp]) covering the interior of the building's floor plan ([polylines_plantabaixa_georef.shp]). In this step, it is important to ensure that the lines start from entrances to exits and from doors to corridors, enabling better classification of corridors in the next step.

STEP 10:
Categorize your corridor lines ([line_corridor.shp]) as primary, secondary, and tertiary; primary corridors are those that start and/or end at entrances/exits of building floors ([primary_line_corridor.shp]), secondary corridors connect doors to primary corridors ([secondary_line_corridor.shp]), and tertiary corridors are areas not directly covered by doors and entrances/exits but still have potential for people circulation ([tertiary_line_corridor.shp]).

STEP 11:
Merge categorized and linked corridors point-to-point sequentially ([mesh.shp]) to generate a network mesh ([network.net]).

STEP 12:
Generate routes and define stopping points.
