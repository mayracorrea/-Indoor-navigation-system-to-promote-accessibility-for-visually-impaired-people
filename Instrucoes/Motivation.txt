 The University of Bras√≠lia (UnB) has approximately 40 thousand regularly registered students. Of these, 0.12% have visual impairment and 1.16% have other disabilities.
 The institution's courses are offered in an open series format, in which students have free choice to select the subjects to be taken during each semester. 
However, location problems often occur, especially for users who are unfamiliar with the campus or who have a disability.
